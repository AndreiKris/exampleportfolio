# About me

Welcome to the portfolio of my Data Science projects. My name is Andrei and I am a data analyst/scientist. 

I have been working with data for over 30 years, starting as a database developer focused on relational databases. Over the years, I transitioned into roles as a data analyst and consultant, helping businesses audit and implement performance systems for contact centers, customer satisfaction, and other key business metrics, particularly in large financial and telecom companies. 
##### Business Intelligence and Data Engineering
In recent years, my focus shifted to developing BI reports, working with platforms like Power BI, MicroStrategy, DOMO, and Tableau. During this time, I gained valuable experience preparing both operational reports for hundreds of users and strategic reports for senior stakeholders. As expected, about 70% of my time I would spend on exploring and cleaning raw data and preparing a semantic models for the future visualisations. I worked with a variety of data sources, from relational databases like Microsoft SQL and Teradata to Big Data systems such as GCP, BigQuery, and Hadoop. Usually I provided end-to-end service from gathering business requirements to final report delivery, including the ongoing support of change management.
##### Not only Averages 
While working closely with business users and their metrics, I observed that they typically prefer straightforward metrics like average handle time, daily sales volumes, monthly number of complaints or annual revenue. However, these metrics, while easy to understand, don’t provide a full picture of what’s happening with our clients or business processes. This realisation pushed me towards more complex metrics and better tools for analyzing historical data.
##### Begining of Data Scientist Journey
This path ultimately led me to the field of Data Science. As I delved deeper into statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, I realized how much more precise and insightful data analysis and forecasting can become with the right tools. I'm now exploring neural networks and AI systems, and through this portfolio, I aim to showcase some of the most interesting projects I’ve worked on, which reflect the skills I’ve developed. 

I hope that visitors will find something intriguing here, or have questions they would like to discuss, and I’d be happy to answer them, either here or via email.
