# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I’m Andrei! I’ve been working with data for over 30 years, starting out as a database developer. Over time, I moved into data analytics and consulting, helping businesses measure performance in areas like customer service, contact centers, and business operations. Most of my work has been with large financial and telecom companies, where data-driven decisions are key.

#### Business Intelligence and Data Engineering

In recent years, I’ve focused on building BI reports using tools like Power BI, MicroStrategy, DOMO, and Tableau. I’ve created everything from daily operational reports for hundreds of users to high-level KPI dashboards for senior leaders. A big part of my work has been preparing and cleaning data—because let’s be honest, raw data is rarely perfect. I’ve worked with all kinds of data sources, from SQL databases (Microsoft SQL, Teradata) to Big Data platforms like GCP, BigQuery, and Hadoop. Usually, I handle the end-to-end process—from gathering business requirements to building reports and making sure they stay relevant as things change.

#### Moving Beyond Simple Metrics 
One thing I’ve noticed while working with business users is that they tend to rely on simple metrics: average handling time, daily sales, monthly complaints, annual revenue. These numbers are easy to understand but don’t always tell the full story. That’s what got me interested in deeper analysis—finding patterns, building smarter metrics, and using better tools to explore historical data.

#### Begining of Data Scientist Journey
This naturally led me to Data Science. As I started learning more about statistics and machine learning, I saw how much more powerful data analysis and forecasting can be with the right techniques. Now, I’m exploring neural networks and AI, and I’ve put together this portfolio to share some of my most interesting projects.

Take a look around, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me!
